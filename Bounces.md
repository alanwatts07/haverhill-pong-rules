# 🏀 Bounce Shot Rules 🏀

## Scoring System
- Base hit = 1 cup
- Each bounce = +1 additional cup
- **Example:**
  - 1 bounce = 2 cups total
  - 2 bounces = 3 cups total
  - 3 bounces = 4 cups total

## Cup Selection
- Shooting team gets original cup hit
- Defending team selects additional cups
- Selection must be made immediately
- Cups can be chosen from anywhere on table
- Lucky/chaotic bounces count the same as intentional ones

## Defense Rules
- Any bounce (table, lid, or cup) can be defended
- Defense must be after bounce and before cup entry
- Successful defense = no cups removed
- Failed defense = normal bounce rules apply

## Bounce Clarification

- Ball bouncing off table surface
- Multiple table bounces = multiple bonus cups
- Table → Cup = 1 bounce (2 cups total)
- Table → Table → Cup = 2 bounces (3 cups total)

### Not Counted as Bounces ❌
- Bouncing off cup lids
- Bouncing off cup sides
- Cup lid → Cup = No bounce (1 cup only)
- Cup lid → Table → Cup = 1 bounce (2 cups total)

*Note: Lucky bounces are part of the game - all count the same!*
