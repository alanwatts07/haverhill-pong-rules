# 💦 Hydration Cup Modifier 💦

## Basic Setup
- Standard cup formation
- 50% cups = water + ice cube ("hydration cups")
- 50% cups = regular game drink
- Each team gets matching number of shot-filled mini cups ("mines")

## ❄️ Ice Cube Mechanics
- When water cup is hit:
  1. Ice cube must be saved
  2. Immediately transfer to any remaining cup
  3. Multiple ice cubes can stack in same cup
  4. Ice cubes create natural shot defense
  5. Defense lasts until ice melts

### Ice Defense Properties
- Shots can deflect off ice
- More ice = better defense
- Fast cup removal = ice cube stacking
- Strategic ice placement allowed
- Defense weakens as ice melts

## Game Mechanics

### Hydration Rules
- When opponent hits your water cup:
  1. Drink the water immediately
  2. Must choose one of your "mines" to take as shot
  3. Save and transfer ice cube
  4. Both cups removed from play

## ⚠️ Mine Penalty System ⚠️

### 🎯 Direct Mine Hit
If shooter lands in opponent's mine cup:
- 🥃 Shooter must drink the mine
- 💧 Defending team gets free water cup hydration
- 🗑️ Only mine removed from play
- ❌ No mine shot required for defender if more water cups than mines to take

## ☢️ ARMAGEDDON ☢️

### 💀 Spill Scenario
If shooter knocks over an opponent's mine cup:
- 🥃 Shooter must drink ALL remaining mines on opposing side
- 👑 Defending team wins automatically
- 🚫 No redemption possible
- 😱 Ultimate shame bestowed upon the spiller

### 📜 Ancient Proverb
*"Waste not the precious fluid, for it brings great dishonor upon your house"* 

⚠️ Remember: A steady hand prevents Armageddon! ⚠️

## End Game
- Game ends when all large cups eliminated
- Or when a mine is knocked over ('armegeddon')
- Standard redemption rules apply
- Remaining mines don't affect game outcome

### 💭 Strategy Tips
- Track opponent's water cups
- Manage mine inventory
- Avoid opponent's mines
- Strategic ice cube placement
- Stay hydrated!

*Note: Ice cube stacking adds dynamic defense that changes as the game progresses! 🧊*
